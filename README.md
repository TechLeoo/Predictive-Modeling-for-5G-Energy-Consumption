# Predictive Modeling for 5G Energy Consumption
 Network operational expenditure (OPEX) already accounts for around 25 percent of the total telecom operatorâ€™s cost, and 90 percent of it is spent on large energy bills. More than 70 percent of this energy is estimated to be consumed by the radio access network (RAN), particularly by the base stations (BSs). Thus, the objective is to build and train a ML model to estimate the energy consumed by different 5G base stations taking into consideration the impact of various engineering configurations, traffic conditions, and energy-saving methods.
